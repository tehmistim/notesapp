Teaching by DevMountain/BrightPaths Instructors and TA and Brad Traversy @ Traversy Media 

After 4 hours of courses he teaches on Udemy I followed one of his projects to create this alongside the video tutorial.

This is my first attempt at a app from scratch and couldn't have done it without his videos!
